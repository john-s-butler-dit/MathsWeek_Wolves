# Maths Week 
I made this notebook for Maths Week 2019 for my visit to fourth class primary school.

## How maths can model the reintroduction of Wolves to Ireland

This repository contains a jupyter notebook which demonstrates how maths can be used to model an ecosystem. 
I use the predator prey equation to illustrate how the introduction of Wolves could result in an 
increase in the deer population.
